###Final Project Proposal

For my final project, I hope to realize my childhood dream of having a pet dragon. Or at least, an ornithopter which flies like one. In order to make this project feel a little more achievable, I have broken it down into several goals:

I. an ornithopter with wings modelled after bats or pterosaurs which can achieve sustained flight

>> This is my primary goal; I will have to do research on the structure of different wings and find suitable materials with which to mimic that structure. 

II. giving my ornithopter the ability to move across ground

>> One of the key features of dragons in mythology or fiction is that they can move both through air and on land.

III. making it look aesthetically like a dragon: head, tail, scales, etc.

IV. takeoff from rest

>> This is likely a reach, but it would be very cool.
