### Final Project

## Initial Ideas


For my final project, I hope to realize my childhood dream of having a pet dragon. Or at least, an ornithopter which flies like one. My primary goal with this project is to end up with a working ornithopter which uses wings modelled after bats or pterosaurs. To achieve this, I will have to do research on the structure of different wings and find suitable materials with which to mimic their structure. 

One of the key features of dragons in mythology or fiction is that they can move both through air and on land, so my second goal is to give my ornithopter the ability to move on the ground. Preferably, this would be done with hind legs and using the folded wings as forelegs, but I may have to reevaluate the feasibility of that.

I also want my dragon to look like a dragon. The wings and general shape should go a long way to communicate that, but I'd also be interested in seeing how I can design a long head and tail which don't interfere with the aerodynamics of the ornithoptor.
