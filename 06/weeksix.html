### Inputs

## Concept & Inspirations

For my microcontroller week, I used a distance sensor to control a kinetic sculpture representation of Daphne from the myth of Daphne and Apollo. As the distance sensor is a fairly useful sensor, I decided to calibrate it for this week's assignment.

## Design Process

As with the microcontroller project, I wired my distance sensor to the ESP32 as shown:

I used the following code to record the readings from the distance sensor at different distances as measured by the ruler:

<pre><code>
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(5);
  digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);

  pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);
  duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
  Serial.println(duration);
</code></pre> 

Using these, I entered my data into a spreadsheet and used it to calibrate the sensor. The distance in inches should be the duration reading divided by the slope of the line, shown on the graph.

*this says centimeters, but it should be inches. I use centimeters for the capacitive sensor portion.


I decided to try a different type of distance sensor for the second part of this assignment: a capacitive distance sensor. I connected the aluminum of my capacitor through a 10k ohm resistor to an input pin on the ESP32. I used the same setup as before to graph my readings against actual distance, though this time they were averaged over 200 readings for a bit more precision.

<pre><code>
  const int numMeasurements = 100;
  for (int i = 0; i < numMeasurements; i++) { // get the average of 100 readings to smooth out the data
     sensorValue += Sensor.capacitiveSensor(1000);
     delay(10);
  }
</code></pre> 

The graph in this case looked a little different:
