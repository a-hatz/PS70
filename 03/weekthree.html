### Kinetic Sculpture

## Concept & Inspirations

I really love artistic portrayals of Apollo and Daphne, particularly the imagery of Daphne turning into a tree. I wanted to recreate this sculpture with a moving component, so that Daphne could grow branches and become encased in wood right in front of your eyes. 

<img class="three" src="./apollo_and_daphne.jpg">

## Design Process

Originally I thought the moving component of my sculpture might involve pushing branches or leaves up through a hollow depiction of daphne using some system of gears or linkages. Upon further thought, I decided that this would not be as aesthetically pleasing as I would like it to be, and came up with a new solution.
