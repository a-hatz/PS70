### Final Project

## Initial Ideas

For my final project, I hope to realize my childhood dream of having a pet dragon. Or at least, an ornithopter which flies like one. My primary goal with this project is to end up with a working ornithopter which uses wings modelled after bats or pterosaurs. To achieve this, I will have to do research on the structure of different wings and find suitable materials with which to mimic their structure. 

One of the key features of dragons in mythology or fiction is that they can move both through air and on land, so my second goal is to give my ornithopter the ability to move on the ground. Preferably, this would be done with hind legs and using the folded wings as forelegs, but I may have to reevaluate the feasibility of that.

I also want my dragon to look like a dragon. The wings and general shape should go a long way to communicate that, but I'd also be interested in seeing how I can design a long head and tail which don't interfere with the aerodynamics of the ornithoptor. 

## Minimum Viable Product: Design Process

For my minimum viable product, I wanted only flapping wings and semi-flight. In pursuit of this goal, I decided to prioritize the mechanics over the electronics, and use a rubber-band to power the flapping motion.

For a simplified flapping mechanism, I decided to use a bent axel and linkage. The structure of the body was made of wooden sticks, as those were lightweight while sttrong, and the wings were a simple thin plastic. I found that paperclip wires were the exact balance between strength, weight, and flexibility that I wanted for both the axel and the connecting pieces of the linkage. This first prototype ended up a success: my MVP could flap in the air when thrown and suspend itself briefly before coming to the ground.

## Integration with ESP32 XIAO

My next step was to make this mechanism work with electronics. This presented much more of a challenge. At first, I thought to use the ESP32 that I had been using all semester, but I ultimately decided that it would make more sense to use a lighter-weight microcontroller: the xiao. However, this meant that I had to learn an entirely new structure, which took a while. In fact, I spent nearly a day just trying to connect the xiao to my computer (mostly because I made some silly mistakes, but still). However, I was ultimately able to connect the xiao and run the motor through a motor driver using the code below (actually, slightly different code, but this does essentially the same thing.)

<pre><code>
  // Motor control pins
  const int motorPin1 = 26;
  const int motorPin2 = 27;

  // Motor control duration
  const unsigned long motorRunTime = 10000; // 10 seconds

  void setup() {
    // Initialize motor pins as outputs
    pinMode(motorPin1, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(motorPin2, OUTPUT);
    
    // Stop the motors initially
    stopMotors();
  }

  void loop() {
    // Run the motors for the specified duration
    runMotors();
    delay(motorRunTime);
    
    // Stop the motors
    stopMotors();
    
    // Wait for some time before running the motors again
    delay(2000); // 2 seconds delay before next run
  }

  void runMotors() {
    // Motor rotation direction and speed control
    digitalWrite(motorPin1, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(motorPin2, LOW);
  }

  void stopMotors() {
    // Stop the motor rotation
    digitalWrite(motorPin1, LOW);
    digitalWrite(motorPin2, LOW);
  }

## Tail Motion

An interlude to address my secondary goal: I also wanted this dragon to have something approximating ground motion, in addition to flapping wings. I looked into a few different mechanisms for this, mostly involving legs, but I thought that a more amphithere-like design would be more efficient, as it would require only one additional motor. In my research, I came across this paper: [Single actuator wave-like robot (SAW): design, modeling, and experiments](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-3190/11/4/046004). I thought the motion was perfect for my purposes--if I was to attach a wheel to the front of the robot, the wave of the tail could theoretically propel the robot forward on land. I printed the following files:

<a download href='./draxtaillink.stl'> Link Piece (STL) <a>
<a download href='./draxtailaxel.stl'> Axel (STL) <a>

The first is a link of the tail: each link is conected to eachother and to the larger structure of the robot, remaining upright. The second is the axel; attached to the motor, the movement of the axel through the stationary links creates this wave-like motion with travels up and forwards trhough the tail.

Here's my final mechanical design (it's very large and cannot actually move, but the forms of motion are there.)
